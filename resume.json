In my work the joy translates to working hard and completing my projects. It does not matter if this is to solve complex issues, creating a report or starting something new and unknown. I will perform the tasks with undivided attention and dedication. Leaving no moment untouched to celebrate. As a Burgundian I know how to appreciate good food and company.",
