    "brief": "Curious, having fun and enjoying life are my core values. Whether it concerns my personal or my professional life. As a father, I see the joy in my children every dag. In my work the joy translates to working hard and completing my projects. It does not matter if this is to solve complex issues, creating a report or starting something new and unknown. I will perform the tasks with undivided attention and dedication. Leaving no moment untouched to celebrate. As a Burgundian I know how to appreciate good food and company."
